I call this repository playing because it is from here that im
free to do my own crazy stuffs that are somehow related to ALX but not 
completely ALX assignments. Here everything is mixed up you will find 
data structures you will even find different programming languages and even 
scripting languages. Whatever is here is my own cocktail of skills that i'm learning
or i have already learned.
